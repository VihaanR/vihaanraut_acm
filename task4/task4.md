Search Engine Optimisation has been a staple topic of discussion in the Web Development community however since the past half of the decade Generative AI has revolutionised accessibility
of data that is direct in nature rather than the array of blue links to scour through search engines . This has led to the rise of Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO).

The article begins with a concise explanation on how GEO has changed the way we view SEO . Previously , it was how we could structure it such that it could attain a superior heriarchy among other search
results however now it is more about how your content fuels AI-generated answers.Hence, clarity and structured data dominate over keywords , backlinks and metadata.

The impact is later highlighted regarding how as opposed to the previous process of scouring through numerous links we just get straight up comprehensive outputs from 
AI engines changing how users engage with content with a staggering 80% of users in 2025 opting for AI-generated output as cited by an article on [sociolabs](https://sociolabs.in/generative-engine-optimization-seo-revolution-in-2025/).
The blog then shifts to explaining how essential it is to adopt GEO  and be upto date with the current paradigm shift.

The article transitions to providing tips for being under the rader of AI agents . Importance was given to direct structured answers with verified sources as well as schema implementation. 

The conclusion again summarised all the points mentioned thoughout the blog and establish that it is not that far that soon GEO will replace SEO as direct accurate answers are in current demand owing
to the convenience and authoritative direct solutions that generative AI provide

## Conclusion

This article really hit the nail with the monopoly shift of how information would be accessed by users online . Furthermore, I thought about it through the lens of research work we would document
as part of my work as a Research Co-Com member in ACM . After all , research papers give massive importance to keywords , however following this article , it has dawned upon me that soon we researchers will also have to
employ such GEO based methods in order for our work to get highlighted by various engines which excites me a lot as a hybrid outlook would need to be adopted where we would need to juggle between keywords and an outlook of direct AI-friendly research documentation
in order to be under the radar of such AI engines , LLMs and so on. GEO is indeed very interesting.
